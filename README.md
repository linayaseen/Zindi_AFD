 ## Overview
South Africa has one of the highest crime rates in Africa, with approximately 2 million crimes reported every year. Women experience crime and are vulnerable to crime in different ways from men. Studies find that while men in South Africa are more likely to be a victim of any type of crime in general, women are more likely to be a victim of particular types of crime, including sexual assault and property damage, and on average feel more unsafe than their male counterparts.

We are calling on the women in data science to explore this issue with us. This challenge calls on you to build a machine learning model that predicts a woman’s level of risk of being victimized by a crime given basic information about her and her life.
